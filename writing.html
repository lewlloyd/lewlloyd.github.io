      The vast majority of the writing I've had published has been while working for the <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/">Institute for Government</a>.
      This is a pretty long page, so feel free to use these links to navigate around (I'll add some thematic categories at some point):<br><br>

      As well as writing, I've appeared on TV (Al Jazeera, CGTN, and a range of continental European news channels), radio (<a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/news/in-the-press/5-live-drive-brexit">BBC 5 Live</a> and
      <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/news/in-the-press/newshour-uk-lawmakers-reject-no-deal-brexit">World Service</a>, LBC and others) and on the
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2018/dec/12/chaos-in-brexitland-brexit-means-podcast">Guardian 'Brexit Means' podcast</a>, as well as being quoted in
      <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/887f7f50-dba3-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c">the FT</a> and elsewhere.<br><br>

      I've also spoken on and chaired panels and other events on many of these topics, and presented to a variety of audiences, including multiple government departments, the Bank of England, Accenture, and Make UK.<br><br>

      * Policy Making in a Digital World <i>(forthcoming)</i><br>
      Solo project looking at how government could make better use of data and digital technology to improve the way it makes policy.
      Based on a year of research, including interviews with a variety of policy makers and technologists inside and outside government, and covering issues such as knowledge management, modelling and forecasting, and online public deliberation.
      Lots of the more interesting content (at least to my mind) didn't make the final report, so I've written some blog posts fleshing out the published material here.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/becoming-junior-minister">Becoming a Junior Minister</a> (December 2019)<br>
      A report pulling together lessons from the IfG's <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-reflect/">Ministers Reflect</a> interviews.
      Main personal takeaway from the project is that our political system, where we regularly drop people with little to no knowledge of an area into a position where they are in charge of it for the country as a whole,
      offering them hardly any time to get up to speed and moving them on to another area within a couple of years, is completely bonkers.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/negotiating-brexit-preparing-talks-uk-future-relationship-eu">Negotiating Brexit: Preparing for talks on the UK's future relationship with the EU</a> (April 2019)<br>
      Assessing what the UK government got wrong (and, in a handful of cases, right) in the first phase of the Brexit negotiations and setting out how it should approach the more complex negotiations on the nature of the future UK-EU relationship.<br><br>

      * <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/brexit-effect">The Brexit Effect</a> (March 2019)<br>
      Pulling together research and analysis from across the IfG looking at the impact of Brexit on different aspects of government, including the civil service, parliament, and devolution.
      Published on the day the UK was originally supposed to leave the EU - 29 March 2019.<br><br>

      <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/brexit-six-months-go">Brexit: six months to go</a> (September 2018)<br>
      A summary and assessment of the progress made by government in preparing for Brexit, with only 6 months to go before the originally planned exit date (29 March 2019).

      <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/negotiating-brexit-policing-and-criminal-justice">Negotiating Brexit: policing and criminal justice</a> (September 2018)<br>
      An overview of UK-EU cooperation on policing and criminal justice (covering the European Arrest Warrant, Europol, the SIS II database and more) and how it might be affected by Brexit.
      Particularly focused on what would happen if there was 'no deal' on future cooperation, and how a mutually acceptable agreement between the UK and EU might be reached.
      One of the most interesting projects I've worked on. Picked up in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-warned-russian-spies-salisbury-novichok-brexit-eu-a8524356.html">the Independent</a>,
