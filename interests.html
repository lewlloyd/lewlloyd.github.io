      I'm mainly interested in two questions:<br>
    </p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>what a sustainable and just society looks like, and</li>
            <li>how to get there.</li>
          </ol>

    <p>
      Or, to put it another way, how to enable everyone to live well without f***ing the planet.<br><br>
      So just the small things, really.<br><br>

      My focus atm is on the role technology could/should play within that, and on what more effective
      forms of governance for tackling complex challenges might look like.<br><br>

      I'm currently using my makeshift blog to keep track of my thoughts and throw ideas around, on these issues and others
      (including books, geopolitics, knowledge/info management - yes, I know, I'm sad - and music).<br><br>

      I also go through waves of tweeting about stuff as <a href="https://twitter.com/lewisalloyd">@lewisalloyd</a>.<br><br>
