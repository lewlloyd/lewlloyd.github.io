      Intelligent Systems (MSc): Distinction.<br>
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:14pt; margin-left:50px">
      Primary focus was on AI, with modules on machine learning, natural language processing, image processing.<br>
      Took additional modules on systems thinking and neuroscience.<br><br>

      My <a href="tweet patterns reveal community membership.pdf">dissertation</a> explored the potential for identifying communities of similar Twitter users
      based on their tweeting patterns over time (rather than analysing the content of their tweets or users' interactions with each other, as is more common).
      TL;DR, this quick, simple approach worked pretty well - although more research is required to develop it further.<br><br>
