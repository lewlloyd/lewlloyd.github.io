      Hey! I'm Lewis.<br><br>

      I'm a freelance researcher working at the intersection of politics, technology, climate change and governance.
      <br><br>

      I'm interested in what the future looks like, with a particular focus on whether 'better' futures are possible
      and how we might realise them. This relates not only to the sorts of 'policy' changes that might be required,
      but also to ways of changing culture and behaviour more broadly, improving governance structures and decision-making,
      and updating the infrastructure available to support interesting projects, initiatives and communities.
      <!-- for a more comprehensive list of my interests, see this page etc. -->
      <br><br>

      <!--
      I work primarily in three modes:<br>
      <ul>

        <li>Analysis - detailed research on specific issues, usually based on comprehensive lit reviews and interviews,
            to help understand causes and effects etc. Outputs include reports, slide decks, systems maps...</li>
        <li>Advocacy - making the case for a specific course of action, such as a policy change.</li>
        <li>Ideation - more speculative, open-ended thinking and exploration of topics...</li>
    </ul>
      -->

      <!--
      As with seemingly half the world, I write a newsletter. It's called Anticipant, touches on all the above (and more), and you can subscribe here.
      For longer pieces, try the <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. I'm also on <a href="https://twitter.com/lewisalloyd">Twitter</a>
      and run a monthly reading group. <br><br>

      For more on what I've studied and been paid to do, see <a href="CV.html">here</a>.<br><br>

      <!-- I have a range of other project ideas I'm keen to pursue when I have the time...there's a list here - let me know if you want to collaborate -->


      I'm currently a researcher with the <a href="https://soif.org.uk/">School of International Futures</a>
      and am supporting the <a href="https://www.infectedbloodinquiry.org.uk/">Infected Blood Inquiry</a>'s expert group
      on Public Health and Administration. <!-- I am also an Associate at Leapwise --> <br><br>

      Prior to going freelance, I spect 3 years at the Institute for Government working on <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/brexit-effect">Brexit</a>,
      ways to <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/policy-making-digital-world">improve policy making</a>,
      and the UK government's use of data and technology.
      There's a full list <a href="publications.html">here</a> of the reports and articles I had published while I was there. <!-- for a more complete CV, see here... --> <br><br>

      My research has been featured on the BBC and in the FT, The Guardian, The Times and elsewhere, and I've provided commentary
      on television, radio and podcasts, including Al Jazeera, BBC Radio and LBC.<br><br>
