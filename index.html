        Hey, I'm Lewis. Welcome to my little online garden. <br><br>
        It's nothing much - just a few links to things that I do or have done. To be developed when I get a chance to tend to it properly.<br>
      </p>

        I'm currently interested in the impact of new technologies on
        government, climate, and knowledge.<br>
        For more details, see <a href="interests.html">here</a>.
        I tweet about this stuff, and occasionally other things, as
        <a href="https://twitter.com/lewisalloyd">@lewisalloyd</a>.<br><br>
        <!--add something about blog once that's done...-->

        Most of my work is research and writing.
        By day, that happens at the <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/">Institute for Government</a>,
        where I work on government effectiveness.
        But I've also done other bits and pieces - there's a full list
        <a href="writing.html">here</a>.<br><br>

        I <a href="https://github.com/lewlloyd">code</a>, make electronic music,
        and (used to) <a href="https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=65995">run</a>.
