        Hey, welcome to my little online garden. <br><br>
        It's nothing much - just a few links to things that I do or have done. To be developed when I get a chance to tend to it properly.<br>
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:5pt">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \ \ | / /<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \ | /<br>

      </p>

      <p>
        I mostly research and write about things, with a focus on data/technology, climate change and goverment. For more on my interests, see <a href="interests.html">here</a>.<br><br>

        For what I'm thinking about at the moment, try the blog or <a href="https://twitter.com/lewisalloyd">Twitter</a>.<br><br>

        For reports and articles I've had published, there's a probably incomplete list <a href="writing.html">here</a>.<br><br>

        Aaaaand if you want some more generic info on what I've studied and been paid to do, and even some things I've done off my own back, try this page.<br><br>

        I also <a href="https://github.com/lewlloyd">code</a>, make electronic music,
        and (used to) <a href="https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=65995">run</a>.

        If any of this is of interest, or if you need help with a research (or other?) project, drop me a line: lewisalexanderlloyd@gmail.com
