        Hey, welcome to my little online garden. <br><br>
        It's nothing much - just a few links to things that I do or have done. To be developed when I get a chance to tend to it properly.<br>
      </p>

        For an overview of my interests, see <a href="interests.html">here</a>. (TLDR: climate / tech / government) <br><br>

        For what I'm thinking about at the moment, try the blog or <a href="https://twitter.com/lewisalloyd">Twitter</a>.<br><br>

        For research and writing I've had published elsewhere, there's a probably incomplete list <a href="writing.html">here</a>.<br><br>

        Aaaaand if you want some more generic info on what I've studied and been paid to do, and even some things I've done off my own back, try this page.<br><br>

        I also <a href="https://github.com/lewlloyd">code</a>, make electronic music,
        and (used to) <a href="https://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=65995">run</a>.
